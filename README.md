## Getting Started

**Step 1:** Install Tailwind CSS and generate the config file.

If you haven't set up Tailwind CSS in your project yet, open your command terminal and execute the following commands:

```shellscript copy
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

**Step #2:** Install TailGrids

Next, install TailGrids by running the following command:

```shellscript copy
npm i tailgrids
```

**Step #3:** Add Tailwind CSS directives.

Create a CSS file named style.css in the /src directory. Then, include this code at the top of the file.

```css copy
@import 'tailwindcss';
@plugin 'tailgrids/plugin'
```

**Step #4:** Import CSS into main.js

Import the `style.css` CSS file inside your ./src/main.js file:

```javascript copy
import { createApp } from "vue";
import App from "./App.vue";

import "./style.css"; // add this

createApp(App).mount("#app");
```

```shellscript copy
npm run dev
```

That's it! Browse and start using the [TailGrids Vue component](/components/vue-link) in your Vue project.

If you want to build the project, you can run 
```shellscript copy
npm run build
```
